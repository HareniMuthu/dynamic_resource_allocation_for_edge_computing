Edge Computing Simulation Tool
A visual and interactive Python application to simulate advanced edge computing algorithms using Quantum Computing, Game Theory, Cross-Layer Optimization, and Collaborative Scheduling. Built with Tkinter, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features
Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
Uses a quantum-inspired algorithm to determine if a function is constant or balanced.

Game Theory-Based Resource Allocation
Equally distributes resources among nodes in a simulated network.

Cross-Layer Optimization
Optimizes bandwidth and power consumption across different layers of the edge computing stack.

Collaborative Multi-Edge Scheduling
Assigns tasks to multiple nodes using a round-robin strategy for fairness.

Interactive GUI
Built with Tkinter to allow users to input simulation parameters.

Visual Insights
Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps for analyzing results.

Technologies Used
Python 3
Tkinter
